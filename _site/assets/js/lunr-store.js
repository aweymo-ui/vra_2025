        "text": "The process I’ll be discussing has its origins in realizing a fundamental lack of understanding of the project I’d been working on for months. After transcribing hours of oral history material, processing thousands of research papers, and combing through metadata to create a digital collection on a natural science archive, I began to recognize a critical gap. My inability to grasp the area where all of the research was conducted obscured both my understanding of the material and my connection to the people conducting the research. I also realized that if I was struggling with this understanding, patrons and researchers using this digital resource would likely also feel this disconnection. &#10042; Example Project Before we begin, I would like to share an example of a project where I felt this type of visualization added another layer of helpful context to the project I was working on. The Taylor Wilderness Research Station, nestled in central Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, has been a vital research hub since the University acquired it in 1970. Accessible only by plane or hiking, it supports wildlife surveys, range land monitoring, and climatology amid over two million acres of protected wilderness. The Dave Lewis Ranch, where the Taylor Wilderness Research Station would eventually be established, 1937. A few years ago, the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) was contacted by station managers to digitize at-risk scientific papers and internal documents. In a separate project, CDIL Fellowship recipient and PhD candidate Jack Kredell visited people involved in the station’s management and maintenance to uncover “often-ignored social and experiential content behind scientific pursuit.” The project, led by Devin Becker, Associate Dean of Research and Instruction, envisioned a collection combining these two resources. The goal was to provide access to all scientific research produced at the station, along with interpretive material to help visitors better understand its historic, human, and geographic context. The idea to map the oral history recordings began during a meeting where I brought a list of locations mentioned in the interviews. To identify these informal sites, I connected Google Earth to a monitor, and within minutes, Jack was guiding me through the 3D landscape and there was a bit of a spark as we were understanding the area in a more complete way. After discussing more complex programmatic solutions to link the recordings with geographic data, I decided to simplify the concept by creating a video combining these elements. Arlow Lewis, the caretaker of Taylor Ranch for several years, far left with glasses. Kneeling on left is Jim Bennett, then a PhD student working on bighorn sheep. Carol Bennett is in the yellow top. I selected the oral history excerpts that I felt uniquely adept at providing a sense of the amount of time that it takes to navigate the area on foot and discussed locations that not only had a geographic scale but a chronological one. &#10042; In the first excerpt, wildlife researcher Dr. Maurice Hornocker recounts a four-day search for his colleague’s dog, Little Red. The emotional narrative demonstrates how far one could venture in the area before needing to come back to base. The multi-day structure of the story allowed me to experiment with time-of-day functionalities, another attribute you can manipulate in Google Earth Studio to visualize the rising and setting of the sun over days, months, or years. This adds a dynamic lighting component to the finished visualization and a more nuanced understanding of the environment they were navigating. In the second excerpt, Dr. Ed Krumpe describes the wilderness area’s history, beginning with modern landmarks, then smaller geographic features, and finally an Indigenous site excavated in 1983. The animation allowed me to use scale and movement to convey the remoteness and historical depth of the region as the recording begins with modern landmarks like the airstrip and the station, then moves to small geographic features like the neighboring creeks, scopes out to massive geological elements and finally to an ancient Indigenous site excavated by U of I archeological teams starting in 1983. In the Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies department, where I work as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, this experiment has been helpful in thinking about ways that we can marry oral history material with geographic visualizations. We are thinking about moving away from proprietary platforms like Google to have more programmatic approaches that will lead to more sustainable data, but this approach is excellent for more isolated research projects where geographic context is key to reader understanding."

        "text": "Contents: Sign-Up | Google My Maps | Adding and Styling Placemarkers | Adding and Styling Shapes | Exporting KML Data Google Earth Studio is a unique hybrid of geographic information science thinking applied to an animation or visual effects workspace. The browser application is a “tool for animating geospatial information to create still and video content” that uses “the same imagery dataset and the same 3D rendering engine” but is equipped with controls to guide viewers through geographic data and export this media in a variety of forms. Sign-Up The only requirements for using GES is that it must be used in not-for-profit purposes and that you must attribute the final product. This takes the form of a watermarked label that is automatically generated when your animation is rendered, the term for the process of converting your composite visual data into a sequence of high resolution frames to create your video file. While you do need to display this watermark, you can control where it is positioned on your video frame during the export process that we will discuss at the end of this workshop. The first step is to visit the sign-up page and fill in what you will be using the platform for. After submitting it should only be a couple of days before you have access. Google Earth Studio sign-up form you can find at https://earth.google.com/studio/signup/ Google My Maps Something I found unintuitive when I first started working with Google geographic platforms is how the different initiatives created over time are interrelated or disconnected from one another. This tutorial will guide you through the process of navigating your map to a single destination, rotate around a polygon and fly over a line path. To create any labels for your placemarkers, change the color and icon of the placemarkers or create shapes like polygons and lines, you will need to make them in Google My Maps. The platform, launched 11 years earlier than Google Earth Studios, hasn’t been sunsetted because it is the only Google geographic platform where users can create these custom elements and export them into Keyhole Markup Language, or KML, an XML based file format to represent geographic coordinates. You will also see the option to export in KMZ, which is simply a zipped, compressed version of KML. Google My Map interface with layers panel on the left to group placemarkers and locations. If you have a working google account, you will be automatically signed into My Maps with that account and your projects will be saved under it. For this exercise, I thought it might be interesting to build this test around a map of mining locations north of Spokane from the Northwest Mining News magazine from 1907. Mining map published by Northwest Mining News in Spokane, Washington in 1901. &#10042; Adding and Styling Placemarkers Looking at just a few of these locations that will allow us to create some lines and shapes, you enter either place names or latitude and longitude into the search bar, or select the placemarker icon below for a custom location. Pressing enter, a placemarker will appear. Selecting the plus sign on this pop-up will Add To Your Map, which will be associated to your Untitled Layer by default. Adjusting the styling of placemarkers in Google My Maps Selecting the placemarker, you can change the styling of the color and icon with the paint button symbol or adjust the label or description of the item by selecting the pencil icon. Note that metadata you put in the description field or images you attach with the camera icon will not generate in GES (although they will in Google Earth). If you want to adjust all of your labels quickly and efficiently, you can select the ellipses to the right of your layer title and choose Open Data Table, which will display your label and descriptions like a little spreadsheet. Expanding the table view in Google My Maps to revise titles and descriptions efficiently. Though you can’t carry over descriptions into GES, you can translate some of this metadata visually. In this map, places in blue are still active towns, black are ghost towns and green were never developed. The pin shaped icons are in Ferry county, diamonds in Okanagan and squares are in Stevens county. Adding and Styling Shapes Creating and adjusting the styling of a polygon in Google My Maps. Now that we have our places, go back to the menu on the left of the screen and select Add Layer. Below the search bar, select the icon with the three dots connected by a line. To draw a line, simply select where you want to go and press enter when you are done. To create a polygon, repeat those steps but connect the last node to the first one you created. Polygons can help highlight distance, natural resources and connectivity between places. In this case, we might be able to understand the distance of a mining district, long term economic influence and geological formations by highlighting this cluster of mines in northern Washington. Note Be less sloppy than I am here and zoom in to your destinations before drawing to get more precision! Exporting KML Data Now that we have our labels on one layer and our shapes on another, select the ellipses to the right of your project title and select Export to KML/KMZ and download the Entire Map. &#10042;"

        "text": "Contents: Easing | Pausing | Single Point | Polygon | Line | Time of Day | Export and Embed A couple of days after signing up, you should be notified that your account has been approved. Opening Google Earth Studio may bring you to an interstitial page where you can select which google account you are using, which will then direct you to this introductory page: GES introductory page If you select the dropdown on Blank Project, you will see GES has a series of Quick Starts, which are an excellent option if you would like to experiment with zooming into and orbiting around just one object or jumping from one point to another. For this test, we will be selecting the Blank Project option. Basic GES interface with single, expanded camera view. The conventional orientation controls are replaced with the following geographic analogues: Latitude = Y position (north-south) Longitude = X position (east-west) Altitude = Z position (elevation) Pan = Y rotation Tilt = Z rotation Movement is established by creating keyframes that manipulate these characteristics along the timeline. The quick key to generate a keyframe is control + Enter. One thing that takes a little getting used to is that you either have the timeline or display section selected. If you would like to add changes, you need to scroll forward, select the display, make your adjustments and then add keyframes. If you forget to add keyframes and select back into the timeline, those changes aren’t recorded. Importing KML files from Google My Maps into the Overlay panel Select File&gt;Import&gt;KML File to import labels and shapes from Google My Maps. This will import your different layers you’ve created as well as the ability to toggle their visibility on and off in the Overlay pane. Easing Detail on the the easing controls, indicated by carrot on either side of the diamond shaped keyframes on the timeline. You will notice that, by default, GES adds an “auto-ease” characteristic to keyframes and you link them. Easing in and out slows you down before you reach your keyframe and as you leave it so the movement is less jarring for viewers. This is generally a good thing except for when you are duplicating keyframes to pause, where this effect is distracting. To resolve this issue, select all of the keyframes and choose Linear. &#10042; Pausing One important thing to keep in mind is that you need to give the viewer long enough to read the labels of destination. In the case of the single destination, we will be stopping briefly to read and for the line and polygon, we will be slowing down quite a bit for visual legibility. The easiest way to make one of these stops is simply to copy your keyframes from the timeline, move a couple of seconds down and then paste. GES interface demonstrating a slight change in tilt and pan data between two keyframes. I find that it is more natural and dynamic to have a very slight movement during these reading pauses than a completely static, robotic shot, so I will subtly pan left or right or tilt up or down by selecting the display and adjusting tilt and pan slightly with the Shift + Arrow keys, then Control + Enter to record these changes / update your keyframe information. Single Point We can do the first “point to point” zoom into Keller by either pointing your mouse and scrolling forward or hitting + to zoom in. Once you have an appropriate zoom, you can manipulate your angle using the Shift + Arrow keys. This brings us to the more precise way you can manipulate movement between points: the dual display. Selecting the box icon to the right above the timeline, choose the 2 option, which will open a window on the left that displays either your x or y axis and iron out any potential errors. By selecting the node that represents different sets of your keyframes, two dots will emerge on either side, representing the “easing” effect, which can be lengthened or shortened depending on your desired effect. The red triangle with a white triangle represents the camera perspective. Dual view GES interface with the left panel changing from North to East perspective. &#10042; Polygon So now that we have paused briefly at a destination and subtly titled over about three seconds so that the viewer has a moment to read the placemarker and understand the geography, let’s jump over to where we will be revolving over our polygon of four locations. Rather than hunting around on the map, I will generally keep the My Maps tab open while I am working in GES and just copy the geographic coordinates from the bottom left of the card and then plug that into the GES search bar. Latitude and Longitude location in Google My Maps placemarker. If you are moving across large distances and moving into close range at both destinations, you may find that you accidentally slip under the map as you are going through mountain ranges. To avoid this confusion, and also make the point to point movement a little more legible for viewers, I recommend adding a “hop”. Simply go to a midpoint between your start and destination keyframes, select the viewer to manipulate coordinates and select the minus key or scroll out to increase elevation. Demonstrating a hop between keyframes to keep from slipping under the 3D layer and create more legible movement for viewers. Once you are in the region you need to work, it’s generally going to make for smoother viewing to simply navigate around your destination with your keyboard rather than entering geographic coordinates in the search bar, which will drop you in at a default perspective and elevation every time. To rotate around the polygon, simply rotate around the shape. Unlike the previous single point, I am not pausing at each point, instead, I’m just slowing down to around three seconds between each keyframe and pausing briefly to an overhead angle to see all of the points together before jumping over to the straight path. Line For the line, I will do the opposite movement: beginning at a higher elevation and more overhead perspective to see everything at once, then moving closer and more parallel with the ground for greater detail. Because you can create any shapes in My Maps, you could potentially highlight complicated topographical elements in really engaging ways using this tool. If you want to end in the same place you began, simply copy your first keyframes and paste them at the end. Significant zooms like this can be a little unbalancing, so I recommend untangling things in your x and y perspective dual screen to the extent you can. Adjusting movement by directly manipulating keyframes in the dual screen panel. Tip For both rotating around the polygon and following the line path, I first created keyframes for every placemarker (and even some between them) and then experimented with deleting keyframes or removing easing on keyframes to get the smoothest movement. &#10042; Time of Day Adding the time of day attribute is a great way to make your visualization more dynamic and add a temporal element if you want to convey a sense of change over time. As people in a Pacific time zone, the one tricky element is that this is set to British Greenwich Mountain Time (GMT) with no way to change the time zone. Here’s a table to help: Local Time (PT) GMT / UTC Time to Enter 6:00 AM 13:00 7:00 AM 14:00 8:00 AM 15:00 6:00 PM 01:00 (next day) 7:00 PM 02:00 (next day) 8:00 PM 03:00 (next day) This is one element where I find it helpful to enter the Graph Editor View by selecting the Time attribute on the bottom left of the interface. To create a gradual movement of morning to evening, create a keyframe that is something like: 06/01/2025 13:00 for 6am Pacific, then another keyframe at the end that is: 06/02/2025 03:00 for 8pm Pacific. If you want to create a sped up evening in the middle of a map, such as between the polygon and the line, create an evening keyframe and morning keyframe at these points and then change your final keyframe to one day later to end at 8pm the following day. Using the Graph Editor View to configure Time of Day attribute so there is a quick overnight effect between the polygon and the line. Selecting the cloud attribute is another way to make a geographic visualization more dynamic but note that both this and the time are based on sun angle calculator tools and static imagery (as opposed to satellite or real time elements). Note: These elements can make geographic elements less clearly defined, so use at your discretion! &#10042; Export and Embed To export your project to an MP4 file, select the red Render button on the top right of the interface. By default, this will export your entire project in high quality as a widescreen video (1920x1080). If you’ve designed everything within the square frame of the default camera view, you can also export 1080x1080 for a square video by selecting the link icon and adjusting dimensions. GES export panel with media format, dimension and watermark controls. The preview window will automatically adjust to this view for review. Select the green Submit button to send to the Cloud Renders. Once the render finishes, you can either go to Animation &gt; Cloud Renders in the GES interface or go to the gmail account you are using, where you will have an email and download option sent to you. GES Cloud Renders panel On the Cloud Render window, if you scroll down below your image preview, you will see an “Additional Files” section with a javascript XML or jsx file. This can be imported into Adobe AfterEffects to recreate camera paths, timing and keyframes along with image frames for further 3D manipulation. Additionally, the finished export can be brought into simpler platforms like Adobe Premiere to add labels and edit between sequences (but remember that the watermark still needs to be visible for use). From this point, your project can be uploaded to social media hosting sites like YouTube or Vimeo or embedded on your site if you are using site building platforms like our own at the U of I, CollectionBuilder. Let me know if you would like to learn more about the latter and I can connect you with materials to get you started! Conclusion I hope this has been a practical tutorial on using this tool to make the way you present your research more dynamic and intuitive.
